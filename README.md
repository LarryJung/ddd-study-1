### 요구사항 
> The sample application used in this article is a home loan processing system and the business use case is to approve the funding request of a home loan (mortgage). When a loan application is submitted to a mortgage lending company, it first goes through the Underwriting process where the underwriters approve or deny the loan request based on customer's income details, credit history and other factors. If the loan application is approved by underwriting group, it goes through Closing and Funding steps in the loan approval process.
 Funding module in the loan processing system automates the process of disbursement of funds to the borrower. The funding process typically starts with mortgage lender (typically a bank) forwarding the loan package to a title company. The title company then reviews the loan package and schedules a date with seller and buyer of the property for closing the loan. Borrower and the seller meet with the closing agent at the title company to sign the paperwork to transfer the title of the property.
